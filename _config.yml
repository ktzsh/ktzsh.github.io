    date: "July 2018 - Present"
    organization: "VMock India Pvt. Ltd., Gurgaon, IN"
    multiple:
      - title: Principal Data Scientist (July 2021 - Present)
        content:
        - line: Led all Data Science teams at VMock across all business verticals contributing to Technical Management and R&D 
                processes. Transformed the organization structure of Data Science teams, implemented Monorepo and MLOps 
                practices using MLFLow and DVC. 
        - line: Managed research team working on standardizing SOTA research to train and make large scale transformer models 
                productionable using onnxruntime, deepspeed integrations, mixed precision training, quantization and gradient 
                accumulation. Subsequently adopted these models across various NLP problems within the company.
      - title: Senior Data Scientist (December 2019 - July 2021)
        content:
        - line: "Led a team of 3 people overseeing all reviews, development, improvements, deployment and research projects for the 
                Resume Parser Product."
        - line: "Tasked with developing a multilingual parser capable of parsing resumes in French Language. Solved the Reverse 
                Translation and Token Alignment problem using unsupervised IBM Model 1 and HMM models like Berkeley Aligner 
                and string-matching heuristics using Levenshtein distance. Worked on developing an in-house Joint Machine 
                Translation and Token Alignment system using MBart Transformer based encoder-decoder model."
        - line: "Deployed production ready prediction models with TensorFlow Serving and implemented Async. Task Queue 
                pipeline using Celery and AWS SQS. "
      - title: Data Scientist (July 2018 - December 2019)
        content:
        - line: "Tasked with improving and maintaining a robust resume parser that required converting unstructured data into 
                structured data and extracting useful information using techniques of NLP."
        - line: "Trained in-house BiLSTM CRF based NERs with Character Embeddings and Attention Mechanism delivering high 
                recall and precision for recognizing various entities as positions, organizations, locations, universities, degrees, section 
                titles etc."
        - line: "Built an unsupervised model using topic modeling technique LLDA and PLDA for fast super-section mappings in resume."

    organization: "Artifacia, Bangalore, IN"
    single:
      - title: Research Intern (ML)
        content:
        - line: Media Engagement Prediction - Devised a framework for predicting the engagement (number of likes) over time, 
                given an Instagram user handle and a query image. Using image features from a ConvNet and hand-crafted features
                from User Profile (Followerâ€™s count, Average Engagement, tagged users, day posted), created the entire pipeline systematically; 
                from data collection, data preprocessing to training the model, evaluation, and deployment for a real-time production system.
        - line: Visual Recognition - Implemented a Machine Learning algorithm to identify all the tags/labels relevant to a given image. Implemented an 
                LSTM-based recurrent model for modelling label dependencies and label prediction and a VGG16 ConvNet for 
                extracting image features (Trained on NUS-WIDE dataset). The model was capable of identifying both the co-
                occurrence of labels, and the attention regions in images. Used Beam-Search algorithm for decoding at test time.

    organization: "Indian Institue of Technology (IIT), Delhi, IN"
    multiple:
      - title: "B.Tech. Project: Autonomous Object Tracking with UAVs"
        content:
        - line: "Developed an autonomous agent capable of tracking an object using techniques of Computer Vision and Deep 
                Reinforcement Learning. Implemented Q-Learning networks like DQN/Double DQN with Experience Replay and 
                simulated the task with a drone tracking a car on the ground moving in simple motions, governed by real world like 
                physics. Deployed a modified version of Microsoft AirSim Simulator for training and testing. "
      - title: "Summer Research Intern: Object Detection and Tracking for Driverless Cars"
        content:
        - line: "Tackled the problem of object detection and tracking using machine learning algorithms. We explored slower region 
                proposal based classification models (R-CNN and its variants - Fast, Faster R-CNN), and faster end-to-end 
                regression based models (such as YOLO) for detection. Subsequently, leveraged detection models for feature 
                extraction and generating detection heatmaps along with LSTMs (Long Short Term Memory) to capture temporal 
                information in sequences/videos for robust tracking and occlusion handling. "
